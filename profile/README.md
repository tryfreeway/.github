## What is Freeway?

Freeway is a speech-to-text app that turns your voice into text instantly — in any app where you can type. All processing happens locally on your Mac using the NVIDIA model, so your voice never leaves your device.

- On-device transcription powered by latest NVIDIA Parakeet v3 model
- Works everywhere: email, chat, docs, browser — if you can type there, Freeway works there
- Supports 25 languages
- Optimized for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
